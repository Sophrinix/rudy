Dexter - a simple app for experimenting with writing Ruby extensions using its C API in D programming language.

(D EXTension En Ruby)

Files:
dexter.c - C prototype of what should work (to see how it should work in C)
dexter_tester_c.rb - a test suite for the above C prototype
dexter.d - current state of experimental Dexter app
dexter_tester.rb - a test suite for the above experimental D application

Current state of affairs:

rb_define_method works as in "available from Ruby and passes tests" works

Getting it on to work with other method definition functions.
